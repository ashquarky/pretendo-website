# Error Code: 678-1006
**Applies to:** Wii U

---

***Note:*** This error relates to the Martini patches, which are now deprecated.

The patcher could not find an unmodified copy of the Thwate Premium SSL certificate. Either you have manually replaced
your SSL certificates, they have become corrupted, or your system version is too old or too new for the patcher to
recognise.

- If you are on a system version older than 5.5.3, perform a system update, install
  [Tiramisu or Aroma](https://wiiu.hacks.guide), and try again.
- Try disabling any content replacement plugins (SDCafiine etc.) that can change which files are read by the patcher.
- If you have manually modified your SSL certificates - such as when using a proxy - reinstall a clean copy from a
  backup. Instructions for this cannot be provided by Pretendo.

If all of these failed, get in touch on our [Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo).

Compatible SSL certificate versions:
- `0005001B10054000 v32` (ALL 5.5.3 - 5.5.6)

`v20` (ALL 5.0.0 - 5.5.2) may also be compatible, but this is unconfirmed. Let us know on
[Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo) if it works for you.
