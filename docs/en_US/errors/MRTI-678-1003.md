# Error Code: 678-1003
**Applies to:** Wii U

---

***Note:*** This error relates to the Martini patches, which are now deprecated.

The console's CFW is not compatible with Pretendo's patcher. If you are using Haxchi, Coldboot Haxchi, Indexiine,
Browserhax or similar, please [upgrade to Tiramisu or Aroma](https://wiiu.hacks.guide) and try again.

If you're sure you're using Tiramisu or Aroma, reboot the console and try again. If the same error occurs, get in touch
with a developer in our [Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo).
