***Note:*** This error relates to the Martini patches, which are now deprecated.

The patcher failed to create a patched version of a file. The original file has not been modified.

Reboot your console and try again. If the issue persists, this is most likely a bug in the Martini patcher - please get
in touch with a developer on our [Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo).
