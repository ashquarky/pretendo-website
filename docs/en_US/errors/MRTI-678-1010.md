# Error Code: 678-1010
**Applies to:** Wii U

---

***Note:*** This error relates to the Martini patches, which are now deprecated.

<!-- Even though Martini has special detection for cert bricks, these instructions are written like it's a cert brick,
	 because honestly you never know -->

The patcher encountered an error when applying the patched files to your system. Files on your NAND have been modified
and your system is in an unknown state, though there should be no risk of bricking.

<div class="tip">
⚠️ <b>Do not reboot your console</b>, return to the Wii U Menu or open the Miiverse applet. If you're uncomfortable
diagnosing the issue yourself, reach out on our <a href="https://invite.gg/pretendo" target="_blank">Discord</a>.
</div>

If you know what `udplogserver` is, start it now and save the output. Press HOME to exit the Martini patcher, then
immediately open it again. If you see an error code, view its [documentation page](/docs/search), but remember not to
reboot your console until the system is in a known state again. If, instead, you progress to the confirmation page, and
you have the option to uninstall patches by pressing X, you may do so. If you are not given the option to uninstall any
patches, reach out on our [Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo), and include a photo of the confirmation screen.
