***Note:*** This error relates to the Martini patches, which are now deprecated.

The patcher failed to write out a backup of your Miiverse applet to NAND. This can be caused by an incompatible CFW or
corrupted NAND.

Try updating to the [latest Tiramisu](https://tiramisu.foryour.cafe) or
[latest Aroma](https://aroma.foryour.cafe) build, as these often contain fixes to the CFW.

If the issue persists, get in touch in our [Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo).
