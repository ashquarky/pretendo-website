**Applies to:** Wii U

You have the legacy Martini patches installed into your Miiverse applet. The current version of the Pretendo patchers have a safer version of these patches, so the older ones must be uninstalled.

Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Martini/releases) page on the Martini GitHub repository

Place your SD card back into your console and boot like normal.

Open the Homebrew Launcher and launch `martini-juxt-patcher.rpx` or select it from the Wii U Menu (Aroma)
